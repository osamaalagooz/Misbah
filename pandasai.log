2023-09-21 17:54:38 [INFO] Answer: None
2023-09-21 17:54:48 [INFO] Conversational answer: Sure! Unfortunately, I cannot plot a histogram for you as I am a text-based AI and do not have the capability to generate visualizations. However, I can provide you with a summarized explanation of how you can create a histogram of merchants for each government.

To plot a histogram of merchants for each government, you would need a dataset that includes information about the merchants and the government they belong to. Each row in the dataset would represent a merchant and include a column indicating the government they are associated with.

Once you have the dataset, you can use a programming language or a data analysis tool like Python with libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to create the histogram. You would need to group the data by government and count the number of merchants in each group. Then, you can plot the histogram with the governments on the x-axis and the count of merchants on the y-axis.

By visualizing the histogram, you can easily compare the number of merchants across different governments and identify any patterns or disparities.
